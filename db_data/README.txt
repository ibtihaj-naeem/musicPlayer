Start the DatabaseManager SWingUI by running the following command in the db_data directory

java -classpath ..\hsqldb\hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing

In the UI that opens:
1) give the connection a name, eg in the text field labelled "Setting Name" type "MyDB settings"
2) Select "HSQL Database Engine Standalone" from the drop-down list of connection types
3) Leave the driver unchanged as: org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
4) Change the URL to jdbc:hsqldb:file:myDBfilestore
5) Click Connect

Now enter the following in the text box:

CREATE TABLE book(
	title varchar(50),author varchar(50),
	pages INTEGER,isbn varchar(17),
	id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(start with 1, INCREMENT BY 1) NOT NULL, 
  PRIMARY KEY (id));

Click on the Execute SQL button. if that was successful you should now see a new table in the left hand window.

Click the Clear Statement button and then enter the following text followed by the Execute SQL button.
  
INSERT INTO book (title,author,pages,isbn) VALUES ('Head First Java','Bates',688,'978-0-596-00920-5');
INSERT INTO book (title,author,pages,isbn) VALUES ('Head First Design Patterns','Sierra',639,'978-0-596-00921-7');
INSERT INTO book (title,author,pages,isbn) VALUES ('Hello Android','Burnette',293,'978-1-934356-56-2');
 
CLick the Clear Statement button once more and enter the following command:

Select * from book;

Finally, enter the following command:

Shutdown

Close the Database Manager by clicking on File->Exit

Look at the files that were created in the db_data or hsqldb directory. Your newly created database is stored in myDBfilestore.script.

We will now access this database from Java.

Note:
Our current setup is very insecure as we are using the SA (=SystemAdmin) user with no password to connect.
In a proper system, you would give the SA user a proper password and create at least one other user 
with limited privileges which will be used to access the tables from your program.
That new user would not have the rights to create/update/delete tables or shutdown the database.
